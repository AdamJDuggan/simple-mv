# Simple MVC Developer Challenge

The aim of this task is to create an enquiry form which saves the submitted data to a database table and then sends an email to a pre-defined address (set in the config.php file). The email should contain an ID reference to the saved data.

(For the purpose of the test you donâ€™t need to actually send an email, just create a method which received all the required data and renders this as a view)

The code has been structured using the Model, View, Controller (MVC) paradigm so you should follow this as much as possible.

### Getting started
We recommend using MAMP to run the code locally. Create a new host called simple-mvc.test and a new database called simple-mvc.
Download this repo into the root folder of your new host

### Routing
The routing is a follows:

- /render-enquiry-form
- /process-enquirt-form

### Database
An SQL file is included inside the database folder to create the enquiry table.

Database connection details are stored in the config.php file in the root.

### Controllers
There is a single controller which handles all requests. You should add your code into the processEnquiryForm() method here.

NOTE: Currently there is a call to a testConnection() method on the model inside this - this may be helpful when setting up your database.

### Models
There is an Enquiry file set up - this has a testConnection() method and placeholders for:
 
 - create()
 - get()
 
 ### Views
 There is a views directory which stores all the view files.
 Inside this is a partials directory which holds the shared header and footer. 
 
 Note: Bootstrap css is loaded in via the header
